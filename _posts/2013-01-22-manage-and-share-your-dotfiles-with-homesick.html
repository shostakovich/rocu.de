<p>Since quite a while I try to find a good solution for sharing my dotfiles between my different computers.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rocu.de/how-to-setup-your-mac-automatically-with-chef/">I started with chef</a>. - Unfortunately this did not work so well. Especially if you also want to use your dotfiles on a server. Also it feelt a little complicated.</p>
<p>The next approach I took was putting my dotfiles into my Dropbox and symlink them. This worked ok. But Dropbox on a server? No way.</p>
<p>So I keept looking. A few days ago I stumbled over <br />
<a href="https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick">homesick</a> - an amazing rubygem that manages your dotfiles.</p>
<h2 id="howtosetitup">How to set it up</h2>
<p>First install homesick:</p>
<pre><code>gem install homesick
</code></pre>
<p>Now create a "castle". A castle is a collection of dotfiles.</p>
<pre><code>homesick generate ~/dotfiles
</code></pre>
<p>This creates a git repro with a /home folder inside. Just put your dotfiles / dotfolders in there. Then push the stuff to Github.</p>
<p>Now install the castle with homesick.</p>
<pre><code>homesick clone https://github.com/foo/dotfiles.git
</code></pre>
<p>Now let homesick do its magic.</p>
<pre><code>homesick symlink dotfiles
</code></pre>
<p>All the dotfiles from within this castle will be symlinked.</p>
<h2 id="thisisawesome">This is awesome!</h2>
<ul>
<li>You feel at home at each of your servers in no time</li>
<li>You share your dotfiles with the world</li>
<li><a href="http://dotfiles.github.io/">You can learn from others and refine your files</a></li>
<li>You can put essential little scripts into a .bin directory.</li>
<li>The castle concept allows you to try someone elses dotfiles</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="awordofcaution">A word of caution</h2>
<p>Please do not put sensitive informations into you dotfiles. <br />
Especially ssh keys, bash histories and passwords in configuration <br />
files do not belong on Github.</p>
<h2 id="tryit">Try it!</h2>
<p>Seriousely. It's magical. This is one of those things that you try out and you ask yourself how you could possibly live without it.</p>
<p>Interested? Have a look <a href="https://github.com/shostakovich/dotfiles">at my dotfiles</a>.</p>
