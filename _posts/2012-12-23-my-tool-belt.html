    rel="nofollow">Patterns</a> as they have both transformed how I work.</p>

  content: <p>Thanks. Patterns looks like a fantastic replacement for Reggy. I do
    already know Dash - but to be honest I did not use it that much..</p>

<p>As a web developer you need a bunch of good tools. I know that tools are something very personal, but maybe my choice contains some inspiration for your toolbelt.</p>
<h2 id="macosxsoftware">Mac OS X Software</h2>
<h3 id="1password">1Password</h3>
<p><img alt="1Password Login Window" /></p>
<p>1Password is my password manager of choice. Why a password manager? Well its the only realistic way of having a different password for every website. 1Password also hold password to servers, my serial numbers + my credit card info etc.</p>
<p>Apart from being more secure it also makes the whole password business much more user-friendly, fills passwords in and submits forms if I want.</p>
<p>There is one downside however: I don't know my passwords any more. When I am at my friends computer I have to look them up in the iPad version of 1Password.</p>
<h3 id="alfred">Alfred</h3>
<p>Alfred is a marvelous application launcher. I tried Quicksilver and Launchbar but both are not as nice as Alfred.</p>
<p><img alt="Alfred" /></p>
<p>Apart of the use as app launcher, Alfred is a perfect keyboard interface for iTunes and my clipboard history.</p>
<h3 id="arq">Arq</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2012-12/arq.jpg" alt="Arq" /></p>
<p>Backing up ones data is important. I use TimeMachine and Arq. Arq back's <br />
up your Data to Amazon S3 or Amazon Glacier. It encrypts the data, <br />
before it is uploaded.</p>
<h3 id="bartender">Bartender</h3>
<p>I use a ridicoulus amount of menu bar apps. Bartender is a nice programm, that helps you to organize them.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2012-12/bartender.jpg" alt="Bartender" /></p>
<h3 id="bettersnaptool">BetterSnapTool</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2012-12/bettersnaptool.jpg" alt="BetterSnapTool" /></p>
<p>BetterSnapTool manages my windows in an intelligent way. With soon simple grips on the keyboard: I can move them from one screen to another, or arrange them in split view to the left and the right side.</p>
<h3 id="chrome">Chrome</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2012-12/chrome.png" alt="Google Chrome" /></p>
<p>One of my most important tools is Chrome. Not only is it a nifty, fast and clutterfree browser, but also a perfect tool for web developers.</p>
<p>The developer tools are right build in and contain everything that I need on a daily basis: JS Console, network activity, debugging facilities for CSS and some basic checks for front end performance.</p>
<h3 id="iterm2">iTerm 2</h3>
<p><img alt="ITerm2" /></p>
<p>I spend quite a lot of time in the terminal. I use iTerm instead of the build in Mac OS terminal. I like the split-pane view, Tmux-integration and that it just kind of feels much better then the normal build in terminal.</p>
<h3 id="macvim">MacVim</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2012-12/mvim.jpg" alt="Mvim" /></p>
<p>For reading code or refactorings I prefer to use an IDE - but whenever I create something new I use MacVim.</p>
<p>It was quite hard to get used to it - but after a few month it just feels right :)</p>
<h3 id="phpstormrubymine">PHPStorm / Rubymine</h3>
<p><img alt="PHPStorm" /></p>
<p>A year ago i used PHPStorm. After my switch to Ruby I use its brother <br />
RubyMine now.</p>
<p>RubyMine is quite expensive and you have to get a new license on a <br />
yearly basis - but its definetly worth every penny.</p>
<h3 id="pomodoro">Pomodoro</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2012-12/pomodoro.png" alt="Pomodoro" /></p>
<p>I am a big believer in the <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro Technique</a>. When I started, I used a tomato-shaped kitchen timer. But it constantly fell of my desk and the ticking annoyed my environment. Thats why I choose to use the little app with the name "Pomodoro". Its gorgeous. It has Things Integration and lives in my menu bar.</p>
<p>I also like that you can write little Apple scripts. Currently after <br />
every pomodoro my Mac locks, to ensure that I don't cheat and take the <br />
break.</p>
<h3 id="reggy">Reggy</h3>
<p><img alt="Reggy" /></p>
<p>Reggy is a small program that helps you create and test-drive regular expressions. Its quite simple and saves a lot of time. I can't imagine how to create complicated regular expressions without rapid feedback any more.</p>
<p>Some of my colleagues had a look at Reggy and instantly wanted this kind of instant feedback for regexe's as well. If you don't have a Mac an alternative might be <a href="http://rubular.com/">Rubular</a></p>
<h3 id="sparrow">Sparrow</h3>
<p>I hate email! They suck the energy out of me. I tried many different clients over the years: Mail, Entourage, Postbox, Thunderbird, GMail. They really don't work for me.</p>
<p><img alt="Sparrow" /></p>
<p>Recently I discovered Sparrow. I like it because it makes email as convenient as using Twitter. You can reply fast and it resides in your menu bar and does not use space in the dock.</p>
<p>What I also like is that it automatically uploads attachments to dropbox and I dont have to send 10 MB big attachment bombs through the internet.</p>
<p>I still don't like emails.. But they are a lot nicer now..</p>
<h3 id="textexpander">TextExpander</h3>
<p><img alt="TextExpander" /></p>
<p>TextExpander stores snippets of texts that i use over and over again. For example boilerplate code that I have to write in PHP to create tests, or email signatures, Lorem Ipsum snippets and such..</p>
<p>TextExpander syncs itself via Dropbox, so that you can share your snippets between different computers.</p>
<h3 id="things">Things</h3>
<p><img alt="Tasks in Things" /></p>
<p>Things is a pretty neat store of the stuff that pops into my mind, while I am working on hard problems.</p>
<p>I can revisit this stuff later and continue to concentrate on the task at hand.</p>
<p>It allows me to plan Tasks, schedule them, create little projects.</p>
<p>Since the last weekend I also use Things Cloud beta, to syncronize my tasks between my Imac at work and my Macbook Pro at home.</p>
<h3 id="sequelpro">Sequel Pro</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2012-12/sequel-pro.jpg" alt="Sequel Pro" /></p>
<p>I already recommended Sequel Pro <a href="http://www.zipfelmaus.com/blog/mysql-datenbankadministration-unter-mac-os-x-mit-sequel-pro-erledigen/">in the past</a> a while ago. In the meantime it even got better.</p>
<p>If you work with MySQL and a Mac and you don't have it - get it. Now!</p>
<p>It makes working with the database fun again. You can have favorite queries, browse your database, alter tables, kill queries in a simple, elegant and time-saving way.</p>
<h3 id="soulver">Soulver</h3>
<p>Soulver is a really nice application that you can use to do quick calculations.</p>
<p>I love it and use it for all my simple calculations.</p>
<h3 id="transmit">Transmit</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2012-12/transmit.jpg" alt="Xenu LinkSleuth" /></p>
<p>I rarely need it, since we deploy using GIT these days - but whenever I have to transfer stuff from a server I use Transmit.</p>
<h3 id="xenulinksleuth">Xenu LinkSleuth</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2012-12/xenu.jpg" alt="Xenu LinkSleuth" /></p>
<p>Xenu is a real gem! I used it for many years now. Xenu is supposed to search for broken links - but I use it in another way..</p>
<p>The last time it came handy was, when I ported one of our projects to a new Ruby version. We have a pretty decent test-coverage - but I did not feel very comfortable anyway.</p>
<p>That's typically when I start Xenu to discover if something terrible is wrong with the system.</p>
<p>Xenu is a tool for Windows but works just great with Wine.</p>
<h2 id="terminal">Terminal</h2>
<h3 id="homebrew">Homebrew</h3>
<p>Homebrew is the missing package manager for OS X. It my preferred way to install *NIX tools. It works like a charm and just feels better than the alternatives.</p>
<h3 id="bashmarks">Bashmarks</h3>
<p>Bashmarks is a little shell script that allows you to save bookmarks to directories. With a few keystrokes you can jump everywhere in the system.</p>
<p>To bookmark a directory:</p>
<pre><code>cd ~/Ruby/amazing-project/
s amaz
</code></pre>
<p>To jump back in:</p>
<pre><code>g amaz
</code></pre>
<h3 id="git">GIT</h3>
<p>My swiss army VCM system. I use it for nearly everything that is related to text. For example also to write blog-articles:</p>
<p><a href="https://raw.github.com/shostakovich/mugim/master/source/_posts/2012-12-04-my-tool-belt.markdown">toolbelt.md on GitHub</a></p>
<h3 id="todovoid">Todo-Void</h3>
<p>For my daily small tasks I use Todo-Void. A small task-manager that I created as a toy-project.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2012-12/todo-void.jpg" alt="Todo-Void" /></p>
<p>As a long-term task manager I use Things.</p>
