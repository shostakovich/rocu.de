I have an awesomeness tool-chain â€” command line tools, that increase my productivity dramatically. In this blog post I want to introduce you to these powerful tools.

## Cowsay

    $>  echo "I love strawberries" | cowsay
      _____________________
     < I love strawberries >
      ---------------------
                 ^__^
                 (oo)_______
                  (__)       )/
                      ||----w |
                      ||     ||

## Ponysay

If you like [ponies and colors](https://github.com/erkin/ponysay) more - I understand. Depends on the use case really. I found ponies way more effective if you want to communicate something that could trigger bad feelings.

## sl - The ls for pros

I often mistype ls. Gone are the days were this was boring. I just lean back and enjoy the show. Steam Locomotives are a big part of being awesome.

## Fortune

If you are as new to programming as me you need help, when someone asks you for you're opinion.

[Fortune](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_ "Unix") produces profound answers to all kind of questions you did not even ask.

    $ fortune
    I am the mother of all things, and all things should wear a sweater.

    $ fortune
    Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from a rigged demo.
        -- Andy Finkel, computer guy

## Conclusion

Being awesome requires a special tool-chain. Having ponies and quotes at your disposal is essential. I think you should give this a try.
