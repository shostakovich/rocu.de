<p>I just finished reading "<a href="http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1591844096/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1638&amp;creative=6742&amp;creativeASIN=1591844096&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=distributrocu-21">Linchpin: Are You Indispensable?</a>" from Seth Godin. The book really strikes a chord with me. Essentially it tells you why its a good idea to not only do your "job". Why you should care to be an artist and why you should engage much more. It suggests that you have much more to offer, then just being a cooperate drone.</p>
<p>It also talks about fear and hesitation. And why you should not listen to this kind of thoughts - <br />
just act on your ideas.</p>
<p>I couldn't agree more! Every other way of working is a waste of your time.</p>
<p>I enjoyed reading the book, because I had to stop and think about what I can contribute.</p>
<p>Highly recommended.</p>
