![You have everything you need - right](/assets/images/2014/Jul/IMG_2136.jpg)

> Yesterday is history. Tomorrow is a mystery. And today? Today is a gift. That's why we call it the present. **Babatunde Olatunji**

This is a reminder for myself.

Live can be simple and beautiful. If you do not complicate it.

You have the sun, you have something to eat, you have a warm and cozy place to sleep you can walk outside and enjoy the beauty of it all.

If you think that you need more, you pay a price. More becomes less.

You buy ice cream and become fat. You get a car and have to work for the bank. You buy cheap food and ruin the planet. You think other people do wrong stuff and try to change them and become unhappy. You try to fix yourself, when there is nothing broken.

Don't forget that life is simple, if you can accept what is already given to you.
