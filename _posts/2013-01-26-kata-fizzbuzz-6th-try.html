<p>I like the FizzBuzz kata a lot. This is my 6th try.</p>
<h2 id="code">Code</h2>
<pre><code>class FizzBuzzGame
  attr_reader :range

  def initialize(range)
    @range = range
  end

  def play
    range.map { |round| answer_for_number(round) }.join("n")
  end

  def answer_for_number(number)
    if (number % 15).zero?
      'fizzbuzz'
    elsif (number % 3).zero?
      'fizz'
    elsif (number % 5).zero?
      'buzz'
    else
      number.to_s
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>
<h2 id="tests">Tests</h2>
<pre><code>describe FizzBuzzGame do
  it 'answers 1 in the first round' do
    answer_for(1..1).should == '1'
  end

  it 'answers fizz in the third round' do
    answer_for(3..3).should == 'fizz'
  end

  it 'answers buzz in the fith round' do
    answer_for(5..5).should == 'buzz'
  end

  it 'answers fizz for every number divisible by 3' do
    answer_for(9..9).should == 'fizz'
  end

  it 'answers buzz for every number divisible by 5' do
    answer_for(25..25).should == 'buzz'
  end

  it 'answers fizzbuzz for every number divisible by 5 &amp; 3' do
    answer_for(90..90).should == 'fizzbuzz'
  end

  it 'prints every answer in a new line' do
    answer_for(98..100).should == '98nfizznbuzz'
  end

  def answer_for(range)
    FizzBuzzGame.new(range).play
  end
end
</code></pre>
<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
<pre><code>FizzBuzzGame
  answers 1 in the first round
  answers fizz in the third round
  answers buzz in the fith round
  answers fizz for every number divisible by 3
  answers buzz for every number divisible by 5
  answers fizzbuzz for every number divisible by 5 &amp; 3
  prints every answer in a new line
</code></pre>
<h2 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h2>
<p>I like this implementation a lot. Using a range makes for a nice <br />
interface and it's <a href="http://www.codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataFizzBuzz">nearer on the specifications</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
..
</code></pre>
<p>So I would argue that it's definitely better then to start with only one <br />
function, that you just pass a number.</p>
