<p>I am collecting quite a lot of data on a continual basis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blood pressure</li>
<li>Steps</li>
<li>Weight</li>
<li>Tracked habits</li>
<li>GitHub commits</li>
<li>Follower counts</li>
<li>RSVP's for the events we host at Gutefrage.net</li>
</ul>
<p>That's why I decided to visualize it on a personal dashboard. This weekend, I invested a few hours and came up with this:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2013-07/dashboard.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>I created a <a href="https://www.geckoboard.com/">GeckoBoard</a>, because that's what we use at the Helpster Team at Gutefrage.</p>
<p>All the widgets including Meetup.com, Twitter and FitBit are available on GeckoBoard already. The only widget that I had to populate myself was the <a href="https://github.com/shostakovich/gecko-lifter/blob/master/gecko-lifter.rb">Lift.do indicator</a>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Is the GeckoBoard worth 19$'s a month? I don't know.</p>
<p>Probably I will switch to something like Panic's <a href="http://panic.com/statusboard/">Statusboard</a> - but this requires a little more effort â€” I am not sure to invest this time until I know that a personal dashboard makes a difference.</p>
<p>Did you guy's try something similar? Then please tell me in the comments below.</p>
