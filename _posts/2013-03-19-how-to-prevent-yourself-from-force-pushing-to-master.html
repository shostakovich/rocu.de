<p>I am pretty reckless sometimes. I forced pushed to master several days in a row.</p>
<p>What does a real programmer do? - He writes a script that prevents him from doing it ever again, of course..</p>
<p>For the longest time this was a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7419244/elegant-solution-to-prevent-force-push-on-master-only">little complicated</a> - you had to <br />
install a hook onto the remote repro. For Git &gt;1.8.2, there's a pre-push hook that was just perfect for my script.</p>
<p>If the hook returns an error the push is not executed.</p>
<h2 id="thescript">The script</h2>
<p>So this is the git hook i came up with.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-ruby">#!/usr/bin/env ruby
# Pre-push hook that rejects force pushes to master.
# Requires Git &gt; 1.8.2

class PushRejecter  
  def run
    if pushing_to?(:master) and forced_push?
      reject
    else
      allow
    end
  end

  def pushing_to?(branch)
    `git branch | grep "*" | sed "s/* //"`.match(branch.to_s)
  end

  def forced_push?
    `ps -ocommand= -p #{Process.ppid}`.match(/force|pfush/)
  end

  def reject
    puts "Force push to master rejected."
    exit(1)
  end

  def allow
    exit(0)
  end
end

PushRejecter.new.run  
</code></pre>
<p>Ignore the over engineering please..</p>
<p>If the current branch is master and i am force pushing it does return an error and the push is not executed.</p>
<h2 id="howtoinstallit">How to install it</h2>
<p>All my hooks are stored in a folder called <strong><a href="https://github.com/shostakovich/dotfiles/tree/master/home/.git_template/hooks">~/.git_template</a></strong>.</p>
<p>It is configured as my template directory for git:</p>
<pre><code>[init]
  templatedir = ~/.git_template
</code></pre>
<p>In order to activate the hook you have to go into all your existing repros and execute</p>
<pre><code>git init
</code></pre>
<p>This will install the hook for you. As I mentioned you need Git &gt;1.8.2.</p>
<p>Alternatively you could place the hook in the <strong>.git/hooks/</strong> directory manually in each of your repros.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I am more confident, that I will not cripple a master branch again. A nice feeling. If you like to have a look at the rest of my setup I recommend a look at <br />
<a href="https://github.com/shostakovich/dotfiles">my dotfiles</a>.</p>
