<p>I have an awesomeness tool-chain â€” command line tools, that increase my productivity dramatically. In this blog post I want to introduce you to these powerful tools.</p>
<h2 id="cowsay">Cowsay</h2>
<pre><code>$&gt;  echo "I love strawberries" | cowsay
  &#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;
 &lt; I love strawberries &gt;

<h2 id="ponysay">Ponysay</h2>
<p>If you like <a href="https://github.com/erkin/ponysay">ponies and colors</a> more - I understand. Depends on the use case really. I found ponies way more effective if you want to communicate something that could trigger bad feelings.</p>

<h2 id="slthelsforpros">sl - The ls for pros</h2>
<p>I often mistype ls. Gone are the days were this was boring. I just lean back and enjoy the show. Steam Locomotives are a big part of being awesome.</p>

<h2 id="fortune">Fortune</h2>
<p>If you are as new to programming as me you need help, when someone asks you for you're opinion.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_" title="Unix">Fortune</a> produces profound answers to all kind of questions you did not even ask.</p>
<pre><code>$ fortune
I am the mother of all things, and all things should wear a sweater.

$ fortune
Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from a rigged demo.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Being awesome requires a special tool-chain. Having ponies and quotes at your disposal is essential. I think you should give this a try.</p>
