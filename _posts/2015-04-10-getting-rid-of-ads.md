Often I feel bad after watching an ad, reading an article about the next health gadget, after watching Apple keynotes or browsing on Amazon.

I feels like I have a hole in the stomach. I have to fight internal fights. Shall I buy the thing I didn't even know about a few minutes ago?

Often I loose and buy. Despite knowing better.

Worst of all - it became apparent to me that these holes in my stomach can not be filled by stuff. They appear again and again and again.

## Getting rid of ads

Here is what I do since about a year - and it works quite well. I got rid of many ads:

*   Install an [AdBlocker plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom) for your browser
*   [Block Amazon and other shopping sites](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-site/eiimnmioipafcokbfikbljfdeojpcgbh) that you tend to browse
*   Prevent watching TV ads
*   [Unsubscribe from all email-newsletters at once](https://unroll.me/)

For all other ads: Try to catch yourself watching as them. When you catched yourself, go on with your life.

For example I look at tobacco ads quite frequently. I have no idea why - I don't even smoke.

## Ads work

They work against your financial freedom. They work against your happiness.

Do not let them punch holes into your stomach and your purse.
