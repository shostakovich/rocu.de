  content: <p>Thanks Grammar Guy ;) English is hard for me — I am no native speaker.
    I'll try to avoid this mistake in the future however ;)</p>

<p>I try to get rid of bad habits and to introduce benefitial behaviors. On a stressfull day however, it's hard to stick to all my resolutions. 2 months ago I have found a solution that works really well for me: <a href="https://lift.do/">Lift</a>.</p>
<h2 id="thebasicidea">The basic idea</h2>
<p>You start by feeding all youre good resolutions into <a href="https://lift.do/">Lift</a>. Every day you check off all the one's that you achieved. This makes it very transparent, what you did and help's you to not forget your commitments to yourself.</p>
<h2 id="gamification">Gamification</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2013-07/lift_gamification.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Lift has the concepts of streaks. If I did something for 5 days for example this is a 5 day streak.</p>
<p>For me this works great. I would not think about breaking my 66 day <a href="http://www.lumosity.com/">Lumosity</a> streak for example.</p>
<h2 id="friends">Friends</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2013-07/lift_friends.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>On Lift you get support ("props") from other people. There are some pretty remarkable guys on Lift, that get a ton of stuff done every day.</p>
<p>This got even better, when my colleagues joined in. It's amazing to work on habits together and receive positive energy all the time. My colleageus and I also founded a group to work on some habits together.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2013-07/lift_superstar.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Lift is the most important app in my life. It helps me to transforming myself.</p>
<p>I have over 30 commitments to myself in Lift. Common wisdom says that this is totally bananas. The amazing thing however is that, on a normal day, I finish most of them.</p>
<p>I am really grateful for this app. I think you should give it a try as well.</p>
<p>If you like Lift — and I am sure you will — <a href="https://lift.do/users/cbafd621538e209c5b95">become my friend</a>!</p>
