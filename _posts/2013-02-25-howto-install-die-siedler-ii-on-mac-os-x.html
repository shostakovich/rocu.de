  content: '<p>Hey Arve. I am not sure if Boxer works for 10.6.8.</p><p>Apparently
    there is some kind of networking support. You can read more about this in the
    FAQ of Boxer.</p><p><a href="http://boxerapp.com/guide/advanced#ipx-networking"
    rel="nofollow">http://boxerapp.com/guide/adva...</a></p><p>As this networking
    works over IP I guess you could relatively simply play in a local LAN on 2 different
    Macs.</p><p>On the internet the one of you both who acts as host for the session
    has to forwards ports: 5479 and 5482(TCP) on your router to the local IP of your
    network. Your friend then can enter your public facing ip.</p><p>In order to find
    out this IP: <a href="http://www.whatismyip.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.whatismyip.com/</a></p><p>Here
    is a guide how you forward ports on a router: <a href="http://portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/"

  content: <p>Hi Robert, I've followed every step until</p><p>Copy the Settlers II
    folder from Contents/Resources/drive_c/COG GAMES/ into another Folder</p><p>...which
    I really can't find - after "showing package contents" I go Contents --&gt; Resources
    --&gt; drive_c (through "wineprefix"), only to realise that there is no next step
    named "COG Games" or "Settlers II folder". What am I doing wrong?</p>

  content: <p>Hey - I just followed my own turorial  again. It works.</p><p>* It is
    important that you install The Settlers with the installer. Otherwise the bottle
    will contain no files.<br>* It is important that you have a look into the APP
    that Wine Bottler creates. For me it is called "My Wine App". You hav to save
    it somewhere during the process.<br>* If you did not download Settlers II from
    COG you might want to look into the programms folder instead.</p><p>Please let
    me know what went wrong if you find out - so I can improve the text ;)</p>

  content: '<p>Half way through the installing process/creating the app - using Winebottler,
    ''new prefix (default)'', the .exe-file from the download from GOG, winetrick
    ''d3dx9_36'', there is an ''error'' saying: ''Runtime error (at 140:148): Access
    violation at address 47A40083 in module  ''gdiplus.dll''. Read of address 0020B924".</p><p>I
    press ''OK'' to the error and then have to ''Select Startfile'' and choose between
    two options; ''Winefile'' or ''Program Files/Internet Explorer/iexplorer.exe''
    - I''ve tried with both and the installation finshes with ''prefix created sucessfully''.
    When trying to ''show package contents'' looking into the created app, I find
    Contents --&gt; Resources --&gt; drive_c (but only through ''wineprefix''), but
    from here I can only choose between ''program files'', ''users'' or ''windows''.
    None of these contains anything regarding the game... Any other ideas?</p><p>I
    really appreciate all your help, Robert!</p>'

  content: <p>Hi - unfortunately I can not replicate this. So here are some other
    ideas to get it working:</p><p>* Install it using the Crossover Mac trial (<a
    href="http://www.codeweavers.com/products/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.codeweavers.com/pro...</a></p><p>*
    Or ask a friend to install it on his Windows PC<br>* Or use VirtualBox + an old
    Windows CD</p><p>It's only important that you get the folder at the end. At this
    stage you can import it into BoxerApp.</p><p>Hope that helps ;)</p>

  content: <p>Hi, I have The Settlers 2 for mac. It does not work on a new mac, only
    on the old one. Is this tutorial for using an old copy of the game and being able
    to play it on newer systems, or is it meant to be used if you have the PC version
    of the game and want to use it on a mac?</p>

  content: Kendal &#8212; My suggestion would be to dine table-service as much as
    you can, and make sure to speak with the chef to share your diet requirements.
    He/She can then create a meal for you that fits your speiaficitcons. Counter-service
    can be difficult as a vegan, though it&#8217;s getting better. Check out the menus
    at counter-service locations before you go to see what might fit the bill. Buffets
    might also be a good option, as you&#8217;ll be able to eat as much as you want
    of the foods that fit your needs.

<p>I recently installed "Die Siedler II" on Mac OS X - this is how I pulled <br />
it of.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you don't have the game - <a href="http://www.gog.com/gamecard/the_settlers_2_gold_edition">go buy it</a></li>
<li>Open <a href="http://winebottler.kronenberg.org/">WineBottler</a></li>
<li>Create custom prefix</li>
<li>Select the .exe file and check one of the DirectX dll's</li>
</ul>
<p><img /></p>
<ul>
<li>Install it</li>
<li>Now right click on the program WineBottler created</li>
<li>Open the package</li>
<li>Copy the Settlers II folder from Contents/Resources/drive_c/COG<br />
GAMES/ into another Folder  </li>
<li>Download <a href="http://boxerapp.com/">BoxerApp</a></li>
</ul>
<p><img /></p>
<ul>
<li>Click onto "Import new Game"</li>
<li>Drag the Settlers II folder onto the window</li>
</ul>
<p><img /></p>
<ul>
<li>Thats it! Launch the game!</li>
</ul>
<p><img /></p>
<p>Well. That's it! Enjoy.</p>
