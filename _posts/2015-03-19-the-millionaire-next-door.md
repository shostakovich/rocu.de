title: "Book Review: The Millionaire Next Door"
---
[The millionaire next door](http://www.amazon.com/The-Millionaire-Next-Door-Surprising/dp/1589795474) has a secret. He does not match your mental image of a millionaire. Not at all.

He doesn't own costly watches, he has a relatively cheap car. He doesn't have his house in a fancy neighborhood. His suit is just about average.

One might even mistake him for a pretty boring dude.

Maybe we are unwise to act like "the rich" - at least if we have absolutely no idea what that really means.

I highly recommend to read [The millionaire next door](http://www.amazon.com/The-Millionaire-Next-Door-Surprising/dp/1589795474). It will change your picture of how you become and stay rich.
