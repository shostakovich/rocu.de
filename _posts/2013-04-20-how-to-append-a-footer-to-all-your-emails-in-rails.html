<p>In Germany and many other countries as a company you are required to add a legal footer to your emails.</p>
<p>Of course you could just add the legal snippet into the footer of each of your emails.</p>
<p>Or you can create a partial and include it.</p>
<p>But theres a better way.</p>
<h2 id="writingthetest">Writing the test</h2>
<p>So let's start with a test.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-ruby ">require 'spec_helper'

class FakeMailer &lt; ActionMailer::Base  
  def any_email
    mail(from: 'a@example.com', to: 'b@example.com', subject: "Hello", body: 'A body')
  end
end

describe 'Email Signature' do  
  it 'appends a signature to every email' do
    signature_divider = "-- n"

    email = FakeMailer.any_email.deliver
    email.body.to_s.should match(signature_divider)
  end
end  
</code></pre>
<p>This fails of course. I did match on the signature divider which contains of 2 dashes, a space and a newline. This is a old convention from the Newsnet and can be automatically parsed by many email clients.</p>
<h2 id="theimplementation">The implementation</h2>
<p>An elegant way of solving this is to implement an mail interceptor.</p>
<p>An interceptor catches mails that are send and can modify their content.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-ruby ">class EmailSignature  
  def self.delivering_email(message)
    message.body = String(message.body) + footer
  end

  def self.footer
    "-- n" +  "Insert your footer here"
  end
end  
Mail.register_interceptor(EmailSignature)  
</code></pre>
<p>The interceptor in our case appends the footer to the body of the message. It needs to be registered with</p>
<pre><code>Mail.register_interceptor
</code></pre>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This is a very simple way to add a footer to all your text emails.</p>
<p>It does not take into account HTML emails and email's with multiple parts. (Though it's no black magic to modify the code.)</p>
