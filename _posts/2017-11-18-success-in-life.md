I ran across this great quote:

<blockquote>
 To laugh often and love much; <br/>
  to win the respect of intelligent persons <br/>
  and the affection of children; <br/>
  to earn the approbation of honest critics <br/>
  and to endure the betrayal of false friends; <br/>
  to appreciate beauty; <br/>
  to find the best in others; <br/>
  to give of oneself; <br/>
  to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, <br/>
  a garden patch or redeemed social condition; <br/>
  to have played and laughed with enthusiasm and sung with exultation; <br/>
  to know that even one life has breathed easier because you have lived-- <br/>
  this is to have succeeded. <br/><br/>
  <strong>

</blockquote>

I like it a lot. Makes me want to be successful in life.
