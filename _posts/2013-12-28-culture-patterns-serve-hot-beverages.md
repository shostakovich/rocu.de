title: 'Culture patterns: Serve hot beverages'

You think you're company culture is bad? You feel stuck? You feel managment should fix it?

Sorry to say it: Managment can not fix culture.

A good (company) culture is build upon many little acts of mutual respect.

It is your responsibility to seed respect and trust from below.

In this series I want to show you how it can be done.

## A can of tea

Let's start with a simple act of mutual respect.

You and your colleagues are probably drinking tea or coffee every day. Since you prepare a hot beverage daily anyway, why not transform it into a vehicle for changing the situation?

## When to use this pattern?

*   Departments/people do not talk to each other
*   Everyone works in isolation
*   There is no synergy between departments/people
*   You wish for more openness and humbleness
*   It is cold outside
*   You yourself drink tea or coffee

## How to do it

Cook a pot of tea or coffee every day, grab a few cups and serve them to your colleagues.

Exchange a few words every day. Listen.

After they have received there share, the last cup is for you. It will taste delicious.

Do not start with people, that you do not respect yet.

Start in your immediate surrounding (your team).

When you feel save enough, offer the beverage to another team.

Start with the friendly people you know there. Then include all the "neutral" persons.

When you feel comfortable doing that expand your circle even further. Maybe to the department/team that you understand the least. Or to the colleague that you have absolutely no respect for.

## Keep going

In the beginning you might encounter resistance. Both internal and external.

People might ask themselves why the hell is she doing it?

Or you might find, that the offer does not come from your heart at some days. Reflect on this. Why do you expect mutual respect, without respecting the other person.

Do not expect anything in return. Do not stop, because nothing seems to change.

Persevere.

People will start to open up. And even if they don't: You will open up and feel at home at other departments.

## Sounds naive?

Seems like a thing a lovely old lady would do.

Consider this: You feel respected at here table. You don't start a heated debate over nonsense. And she will feel great as well.

You know it.

Change you're workplace â€” one cup at a time. It is that simple.
