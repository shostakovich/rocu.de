<p>I really hate to write long commands in the shell. But luckily there's a command for that.</p>
<p>Type:</p>
<pre><code>fc
</code></pre>
<p>and your editor will open with the last command you executed.</p>
<p>Edit, save and leave the editor. The command will be executed <br />
automatically.</p>
<p>I use this little trick frequently. Hope you like it as well..</p>
