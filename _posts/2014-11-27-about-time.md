Imagine there were no days. And no time.

How would you feel about problems in the future?

How would you feel about the past?

What would be you're story without a past? Would there be a story?

Who would be you without time? Would you even be?

What would be true? What would be false?

Would you even think these questions? Would there be any questions?

Can you find the answers in time? If there are answers?

Or do you have to just know them? Now.
