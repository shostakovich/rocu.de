Wealth is the amount of time, where you can do what you want.

## How do money and wealth relate?

_Much money does not equal wealth_

If you hate your job, earn a lot of money, reward yourself with big cars and a big house and spend as much as you earn - you are not wealthy. You are trapped in a situation you hate.

If you are a poor guy and really happy with the world as it is - you are wealthy.

Wealth is not about money. And you should be judge about whether you are healthy.

Of course money can be required to be wealthy - if you can not live a fullfilled life without it.

## Wealth, income and expenses

So what if you have a job, but plan to retire early from it? How does wealth work there?

If you spent as much as you earn, every month and you can not live without the money - you will not reach the goal. You will not be wealthy.

If you can change your spending habits and save 25% of your income, you generate 10 days of wealth per month.

If you can save 50% of your income, you generate 1 month of wealth per month.

If can life of 25% of your income - save 75% you generate 3 months of wealth - every month.

I think you get the basic, powerful idea. Maybe you do not have to work forever after all.

## Wow.. This sounds unrealistic

I hope you remember the introduction. You have to be content doing this. Otherwise this is all just a big pile of money.

But if you can pull this of it’s not unrealistic at all. This is all just simple math.

Even if you don’t believe me - I invite you to think about these ideas.
