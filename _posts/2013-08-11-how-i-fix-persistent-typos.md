title: How I fix persistent typos
---
Sometimes I feel really stupid. I have repeat the same typos over and over and over again.

Take "tapas" for example — I type "tappas" instead. Consistently.

So here's my fix for these kind of situations:

I add a [TextExpander](http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/) snippet that replaces my typo with the proper spelling.

I am not certain if this is the best way of doing it — but this is the first solution that works for me..
