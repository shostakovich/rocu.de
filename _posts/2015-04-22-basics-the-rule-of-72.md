The rule of 72 is a rule that can answer you the question: How many years will my money need to double for a given interest rate?

It closes the gap between an interest rate and what it means in real life.

Here is the rule of 72:

<span class="MathJax_Preview">![t approx frac{72}{p} ~text{years}](https://one-step-at-a-time.net/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_a25562b811b9ff44440a66230e4845c4.gif)</span><script type="math/tex">t approx frac{72}{p} ~text{years}</script>

So how long would your money need to double with an interest rate of 7%? (Average historical inflation-adjusted stock market return)

## Double your money within 10 years?

Or quadruple it within 20 years. That's what's in for you. That's why, even 10 or 15% of your disposable income saved can make a huge difference over time.

That is the only reason early retirement is possible.You just have to save a lot of money and let it sit.

You just have to save a lot of money and let it sit. Or save only a few bucks and let them sit even little longer.

## Or pay double within 5?

Compounding can also work against you.

Say you have a credit card and it charges a 15% interest rate. How fast will the amount you owe be doubled?

<span class="MathJax_Preview">![frac{72}{15} approx 5 text{ years}](https://one-step-at-a-time.net/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_55b7cdb7a22bba4d9bfc0268dd8a1487.gif)</span><script type="math/tex">frac{72}{15} approx 5 text{ years}</script>

This is insanity as you see. Even if you are required to pay off some of the principal every month.

## How do you apply the rule?

> Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it ... he who doesn't ... pays it.
> 
> **Albert Einstein**

So every time you hear an interest rate I want you to apply the rule. It will translate it into something a little more meaningful for you.

Use it to help you with financial decisions. Choose wisely.
