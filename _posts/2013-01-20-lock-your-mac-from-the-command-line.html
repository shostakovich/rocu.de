<p>During my daily work I try to take breaks and move frequently. In order for <br />
me to leave the room I have to ensure that my computer is locked.</p>
<p>I wrote a little script which does exactly this.</p>
<p>I only have to enter</p>
<pre><code>lock
</code></pre>
<p>and my Mac starts to lock.</p>
<p>A nice varitation of this is to use this functionallity together with <br />
my Pomodoro app. It locks my computer after 25 minutes of work for me. <br />
Thats a pretty effective reminder to move ;)</p>
<p>Enough said. Here is the code:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">#!/bin/sh
/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu
Extras/User.menu/Contents/Resources/CGSession -suspend  
</code></pre>
