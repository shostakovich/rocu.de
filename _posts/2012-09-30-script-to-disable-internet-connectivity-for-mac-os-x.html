title: Script to disable internet connectivity for Mac OS X
---
<p>From time to time I really want make it hard for me to seek for distractions.</p>
<p>I found myself using the nice Mac OS X tool <a href="http://macfreedom.com/">Freedom</a> all the time. Freedom disables the network connectivity, which means no Twitter, Facebook etc.</p>
<p>But when I revisited the site I found that the author now charges 10$ for it - Thats just a little bit to expensive in my opinion.</p>
<p>So I went out and it took me 5 minutes to come up with freedom.sh.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
echo "Enough of this filthy internet" | cowsay -s
sudo route -n delete default &amp;&gt; /dev/null
</code></pre>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowsay">Cowsay</a> required. (If you don't want to install cowsay just remove the line!)</p>
<pre><code>&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;&#095;
&lt; Enough of this filthy internet &gt;

<p>To reenable your internet you have to add back the default route or restart your computer.</p>
