title: Lessons from the prime factorization dojo
---

Last week my colleagues at Gutefrage.net and I had our second
Coding Dojo.

I learned a important lessons - even though this wasn't the first time I practiced the kata.

## The kata

The task was to create a class that decomposes natural numbers into its
[prime factors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_factor).

Additionally the factors should be sorted ascending.

Examples:

{% highlight ruby %}
1  => [] # Since 1 is no prime ;)
5  => [5]
10 => [2,5]
75 => [3,5,5]
{% endhighlight %}


You get the idea ;)

This sounds simple and like a perfect candidate for an
introduction to TDD right?

Unfortunately this kata is a bit tricky.

## Performing the kata

The first tests are straightforward:

{% highlight ruby %}
module PrimeFactorDecomposer
  def decompose(number)
    if number < 4
        number
    else
        [2,2]
    end
  end
end


describe PrimeFactorDecomposer do
  include PrimeFactorDecomposer

  it "returns no prime factors for 1" do
    decompose(1).should be_empty
  end

  it "decomposes 2 into 2" do
    decompose(2).should be == [2]
  end

  it "decomposes 3 into 3" do
    decompose(3).should be == [3]
  end

  it "decomposes 4 into 2,2" do
    decompose(4).should be == [2,2]
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

## Now the trouble begins

Now decomposing 5 would be a nice test? Right? Since 5 is a prime it
would only return 5\. But how can we find out if its a prime?

So we could write a function that finds out if 5 is prime. Hm that seems
hard.

What about 6? But then we have to develop a algorithm that works -
otherwise we would just move sidewards and add conditionals.

## Whats the problem?

You do not know how to solve the problem. Not everything is as simple as
the [FizzBuzz](http://www.codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataFizzBuzz) Kata.

Adding another test alone does not suffice. It's a common hurdle for
newcomers to TDD.

## How to solve this?

Grab a sheet of paper and think about the algorithm. Or do a little spike until you fully understand the
problem. Sometimes it's just not true, that a design "magically" emerges.

## Learnings

You need a sound knowledge about where to go - otherwise you will have problems with TDD along the way. Then you have to lean back and think a little bit or get feedback from something else then your tests.

TDD is cool, but it can not solve every problem. Especially not complicated algorithms (this is a really easy one of course).

Another personal learning for me was to watch myself better, when I do a kata the first time.

When the design does not emerge from the tests - I should listen to them. Maybe they want to tell me that I have absolutely no idea what I am doing and that I need to think more..
