<p>A colleague just recommended <a href="http://jonas.nitro.dk/tig/">tig</a> to me.</p>

<p>You can install tig with the packetmanager of your choice.</p>
<p>After you  start tig in your project, you see a list of the last commits and can browse through them using your arrow key or the good old vim style (with j, k).</p>
<p>If you hit enter you can inspect the commit in question.</p>
<p>The other nice feature for me is: if you hit "t" you can browse through the tree of files in the project. With "B" you can see do a git blame on for a specific file.</p>

<p>tig has many more features - just press "h" to get a list of all of them, but for me these are the two killer features.</p>
<p>tig works better then Tower, Gitbox, or GitK, because I do not need to leave the command line.</p>
<p>If you are interested, visit the <a href="http://jonas.nitro.dk/tig/">tig website</a> and give it a try.</p>
