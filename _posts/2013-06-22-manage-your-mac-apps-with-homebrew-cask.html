  content: <p>Hi Robert,</p><p>Firstly, thank you for writing on homebrew-cask. I
    was looking around to find an easy way to setup a Mac from a fresh install, and
    your articles(including homesick) have been a great help.</p><p>I was wondering
    though if you know how homebrew-cask manage the installers for the downloaded
    applications.</p><p>For now, I just go to /Library/Cache/Homebrew and manually
    delete the files. Is there a way to thrash all the installers after installing
    the applications?</p>

  content: <p>Hi Zaki. Thanks for the praise.</p><p>Homebrew-cask uses brew itself
    to manage the cache.</p><p>    $ brew cleanup -s</p><p>Should do the job.</p><p>If
    you want to automate this you can use:</p><p>     $ rm -rf $(brew --cache)</p><p>You
    find further informations on the man page of homebrew:</p><p>  $  man brew</p>

  content: <p>Hi Robert,</p><p>Your post convinces me to use homebrew cask, thanks
    for it.<br>Do you know what to do when an app has an update?<br>Do I have to "brew
    update" or simply update the app as usual?</p><p>For example, in Google Chrome
    I click "Update Google Chrome" when there is an update. But I would know if it's
    the right way to update.</p>

    in via:</p><p>    $ brew cask install --force app-name</p><p>The problem: many
    download urls are version specific, since not all applications have urls for the
    latest version.</p><p>For these apps the download url has to be changed to the
    current one, whenever a new version comes out. That''s why these Casks usually
    lag behind.</p><p>Currently it''s best to use the update mechanisms of the apps
    themselves. (Especially in case of security patches etc.)</p>'

  content: '<p>Zaki Juhari It''s been awhile since this was first posted, but I just
    wanted to share a CLI script that I made specifically to uninstall Homebrew, as
    well as other helpful little things like finding Homebrew-related files on your
    system. It''s been working fantastically, and has had good reception from the
    community so far. I encourage anyone who uses Homebrew to check it out!</p><p>The
    gist can be found <a href="https://gist.github.com/SteveBenner/11254428" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p><p>P.S.

<p>A while ago I became interested in automating the setup of my Macs. <a href="http://www.rocu.de/how-to-setup-your-mac-automatically-with-chef/">I started my journey with chef-solo</a>, however this wasn't really practical for me, so I <a href="http://www.rocu.de/manage-and-share-your-dotfiles-with-homesick/">switched to homesick</a> to manage my dotfiles.</p>
<p>Unfortunately that left me without a solution to install my apps automatically.</p>
<p>Not any more. <a href="https://github.com/phinze/homebrew-cask">homebrew-cask</a> to the rescue!</p>

<h2 id="whatishomebrewcask">What is homebrew-cask</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/phinze/homebrew-cask">homebrew-cask</a> is a <a href="https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew">Homebrew</a> extension that allows you to install your apps like this:</p>
<pre><code>brew cask install evernote
</code></pre>
<h2 id="howtoinstallhomebrewcask">How to install homebrew-cask</h2>
<p>If you already use homebrew, installing homebrew-cask is really simple:</p>
<pre><code>brew tap phinze/homebrew-cask
brew install brew-cask
</code></pre>
<p>If you have <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> installed you should also configure it, so that it recognizes apps managed by homebrew-cask.</p>
<pre><code>brew cask alfred link
</code></pre>
<h2 id="usinghomebrewcask">Using homebrew-cask</h2>
<p>Using homebrew-cask is simple. You install apps using the <strong>brew cask install</strong> command.  Evernote for example, you would install like this:</p>
<pre><code>brew cask install evernote
</code></pre>
<h2 id="createalittlescripttoinstallyourapps">Create a little script to install your Apps</h2>
<p>I store all my apps in a file called <strong>~/.brew</strong>. In order to install the apps I just have to run it.</p>
<p>This is how you create your own:</p>
<pre><code>touch ~/.brew
chmod +x ~/.brew
</code></pre>
<p>Now fill it with the Apps you want to install across all your Mac's.</p>
<p>For me this looks like:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
brew cask install google-chrome  
…
brew cask install rubymine  
brew cask install charles  
brew cask install mou  
brew cask install bit-torrent-sync  
</code></pre>
<p>I <a href="https://github.com/shostakovich/dotfiles/blob/master/home/.brew">have this file on GitHub</a> and symlink it with homesick. When I am on a new Mac I just have to run</p>
<pre><code>~/.brew
</code></pre>
<p>That installs all my common apps.</p>
<h2 id="createowncasks">Create own casks</h2>
<p>There are over 300 casks available already. You can view a list with</p>
<pre><code>brew cask search
</code></pre>
<p>If your favorite app is missing it is really simple to add it.</p>
<p>In the example below I create a Cask for Soulver.</p>
<pre><code>brew cask create soulver
</code></pre>
<p>An editor opens with the newly generated cask.</p>
<pre><code>class Soulver &lt; Cask  
   url ''
   homepage ''
   version ''
   sha1 ''
   link ''
end  
</code></pre>
<p>You just have to fill in the download URL of the app, the apps name, the version, the sha1 checksum of the download and it's homepage.</p>
<pre><code>class Soulver &lt; Cask  
  url 'http://www.acqualia.com/files/download.php?product=soulver'
  homepage 'http://www.acqualia.com/soulver/'
  version 'latest'
  no_checksum
  link 'Soulver.app'
end  
</code></pre>
<p>In Soulver's case the download URL does always refer to the latest version. So in this case I used <strong>no_checksum</strong>, so that this Cask will not break in the future.</p>
<p>Now audit your cask:</p>
<pre><code>$ brew cask audit soulver
audit for soulver: passed
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can install Soulver. And don't forget to open a pull request ;)</p>
<p>Before you do — check the latest <a href="https://github.com/phinze/homebrew-cask/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">contribution guidelines</a>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I am really happy that <a href="https://github.com/phinze/homebrew-cask">homebrew-cask</a> exists now. It closed a gap in my configuration management. I can set up a new Mac in no time. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.</p>
