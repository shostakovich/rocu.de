Rain, thunderstorms, the gurgle of a stream â€” I love to listen to nature to calm down.

I used to use ordinary recordings, but I recently found something better: [breeze](https://itunes.apple.com/app/breeze/id427567418?mt=8&ls=1).

[breeze](https://itunes.apple.com/app/breeze/id427567418?mt=8&ls=1) is a collection of virtual wind chimes. You can select the chime that you like the most (i prefer bamboo), select a nature sound and enjoy the chime in action on the screen of your iOS device.

[breeze](https://itunes.apple.com/app/breeze/id427567418?mt=8&ls=1) is great. If you are into nature sounds as well, give it a try.
