<p>A few day ago we received a ton of error notifications that looked like <br />
this:</p>
<pre><code>(RSolr::RequestError) "Solr Response: Lock obtain timed out.
</code></pre>
<p>The system ran quite nice for quite a long time - so what was wrong?</p>
<p>It took me quite a while to find the problem. Solr was exceeding the open files limit, so it locked to prevent <br />
problems.</p>
<p>But how the hell did it hit the limit? It's increased on all of our servers. But when I checked it was not applied.</p>
<pre><code>sudo su USERNAME
ulimit -a
..
=&gt; open files                      (-n) 1024
..
</code></pre>
<p>The problem was, that I manually restarted Solr a few days earlier, using a rake task. I did not use sudo but su.</p>
<p>If you use <strong>su</strong> the users open file limit will not be applied automatically. Have a look into the PAM configuration for su and guess why..</p>
<pre><code>#Sets up user limits, please uncomment and read /etc/security/limits.conf
# to enable this functionality.
# (Replaces the use of /etc/limits in old login)
# session    required   pam_limits.so
</code></pre>
<p>The required line is commented our.</p>
<p>But even more surprising the file limit is activated in most of the other configuration files like <strong>/etc/pam.d/sudo</strong>. So the problem was really me using su to restart Solr.</p>
<p>What I ended up doing was adding this file to chef, with the comment removed. I don't like this kind of inconsistency.</p>
