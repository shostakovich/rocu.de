We always take lunch to work in our lunch pails. Sometimes, after a hard working day - you find no time to cook something.

It's important to have some recipies at hand that work fast.

## Part1: Prepare the soup

*   1 can of cooked chestnuts
*   1 brokolli
*   1 apple
*   250ml of coconut milk
*   500 ml of vegetable broth
*   1 tablespoon of ghee
*   salt
*   pepper

Put the brokolli into a pot.

Pour it into the pot and turn on the heat.

Wait until all of it is boiling. Wait a little bit longer until all of it is really hot.

## Part 4: Serving it

The next day you just cook the soup again and fill it into the lunch pails.

Add some parsley if you want a great look !

This takes approx. 15 minutes of your time. You created a delicious gourmet soup, with great fresh ingredients.

That simple.
