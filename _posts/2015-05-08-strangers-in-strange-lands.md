We can remember between 5 and 9 digits.

So why do we value our self-images so much?

Would you rather look at the image of a flower or at the flower itself?  

Gaze at the flower and it is marvelous. - Look at the image and you only see a representation.

The thought of a flower.

We imagine our lives - no wonder they feel empty.

We miss everything but the self-image. We miss us.

Let's marvel at the flowers instead.
