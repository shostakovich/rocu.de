title: You are your own master
---
<p>During the last years I realized that I play victim all the time. So I try to actively avoid this.</p>
<p>Let me explain what I mean by that. Every morning I walk to our local train station. Often the train will not arrive on time.</p>
<p>In the past I was angry and unrelaxed, waiting for the train on the same spot. I also complained to my colleagues about the stupidity of the train system.</p>

<p>Here is the problem: getting angry will change nothing. The train will still come late.</p>
<p>Here's what I do now, if the train comes late or if I missed it.</p>

<p>I use the time to walk. It's much better and I am not pissed that much. I am doing something meaningful and am not letting someone else waste my time.</p>
<p>Let me phrase it differently: I am not wasting my time.</p>
<p>If you look at all the instances, where someone else makes you miserable, there's a good chance that you make yourself miserable.</p>
<p>You are the master of your own life. If you choose to.</p>
<p>If you realize this simple fact, you can turn almost any situation. Do not excuse yourself by pointing to other people.</p>
