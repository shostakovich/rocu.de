<p>I often edit files without having the right permissions in VIM.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2013-07/sudo-vim.jpg" alt="VIM can not safe a file" /></p>
<p>I changed the file and when VIM told me that I did not have the proper permissions to save it, I quit VIM and entered <code>sudo !!</code> to try it again.</p>
<p>This was of course stupid of me. Currently I try to be more mindful about this kind of problems and to fix them.</p>
<p>Here's the lines that I just added to my <em>.vimrc</em></p>
<pre><code>" Use :w!! to save as root!
cmap w!! w !sudo tee % &gt;/dev/null
</code></pre>
<p>When I enter <code>:w!!</code> now VIM saves the file as root.</p>
<p>I hope I will not encounter this problem again.</p>
