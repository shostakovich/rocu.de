Most financial books are intimidating for beginners.

I just discovered  a wonder weapon, that I will recommend to novices.

[The Wealthy Barber](http://www.amazon.com/The-Wealthy-Barber-Updated-Edition/dp/0761513116/) a story of 3 young people getting financial advice from a barber.

Despite his profession, the barber is a rich man.

He promises to teach them everything about personal finances in 7 months. One haircut at a time.

I found the book really enjoyable!

**The Wealthy Barber covers:**

*   Paying yourself first 10% of your income
*   Wills and life-insurance
*   Planning for retirement
*   Investing in a home
*   Saving for bigger expenses
*   Investment and income tax
*   Saving for college

I disagree with some of the advice in the book - but only on details.This book is a starting point and the rest can be learned on the way.

If you are intimidated by financial books give [The Wealthy Barber](http://www.amazon.com/The-Wealthy-Barber-Updated-Edition/dp/0761513116) a try.
