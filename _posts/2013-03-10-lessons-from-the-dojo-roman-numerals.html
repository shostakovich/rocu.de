<p>A few days ago we had one of our Coding Dojo's at <br />
Gutefrage.net. This time we tried to implement the <a href="http://www.codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataRomanNumerals">"Roman Numerals kata"</a>.</p>
<p>I always learn a ton, solving such seemingly simple problems.</p>
<h2 id="havealookatourunfinishedcode">Have a look at our (unfinished) code</h2>
<p>Here are the tests:</p>
<pre><code>describe RomanNumeralsConverter do
  let(:converter) { RomanNumeralsConverter.new }

  def convert(number)
    converter.convert(number)
  end

  it 'returns an empty string for 0' do
    convert(0).should == ''
  end

  it 'returns I for 1' do
    convert(1).should == 'I'
  end

  it 'returns III for 3' do
    convert(3).should == 'III'
  end

  it 'returns IV for 4' do
    convert(4).should == 'IV'
  end

  it 'returns V for 5' do
    convert(5).should == 'V'
  end

  it 'returns VI for 8' do
    convert(8).should == 'VIII'
  end

  it 'returns X for 10' do
    convert(10).should == 'X'
  end

  it 'returns IX for 9' do
    convert(9).should == 'IX'
  end

  it 'returns XIV for 14' do
    convert(14).should == 'XIV'
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>Here the implementation:</p>
<pre><code>class RomanNumeralsConverter
  SPECIAL_VALUES = {0 =&gt; '', 5 =&gt; 'V', 10 =&gt; 'X'}

  def convert(number)
     result = ''

     while number &gt; 3
       if SPECIAL_VALUES.include?(number+1)
         result += 'I'
         number += 1
       end

       nearest_boundary_under_number =
nearest_boundary_under_number(number)

       if nearest_boundary_under_number &gt;= 0
         result += SPECIAL_VALUES[nearest_boundary_under_number]
         number -= nearest_boundary_under_number
       end
     end
     number.times do
       result += 'I'
     end
     result
  end

  def nearest_boundary_under_number(number)
    SPECIAL_VALUES.keys.delete_if {|i| i &gt; number }.max
  end
end
</code></pre>
<h3 id="duplicationintests">Duplication in tests</h3>
<p>We tried to remove duplication from the tests. I think we failed. <br />
One of my teammates pointed out that PHPUnit has <br />
DataProviders for this kind of test data.</p>
<p>I didn't think that this was a good idea - but looking at the tests now I have to admit that <br />
there is virtually no value in writing the tests spec style for this kind of problem.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there something similar to a DataProvider for RSpec?</li>
<li><a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3124-give-it-five-minutes">I should give it 5 minutes</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="writethesimplesttestsfirst">Write the simplest tests first</h3>
<p>We had quite a hard time with the substraction rule (4 =&gt; IV). <br />
We wrote a test for the 4 very early - I think we could have made it <br />
easier for us by first ignoring the substraction rule and focusing on <br />
all cases where it does not apply.</p>
<ul>
<li>Write the easy tests first</li>
<li>If you hang try another test</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="acceptweiredcode">Accept weired code</h3>
<p>We "cheated" quite a bit using an array for the special cases. It just <br />
didn't look right. Supprisingly it came together at the end of the session anyway.</p>
<ul>
<li>Accept weired code</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="whentoabstract">When to abstract</h3>
<p>Right at the beginning one of my colleagues pointed out, that we just <br />
could create a big array with a mapping between all the arabic number to <br />
the roman numerals and use that. I think he had a point..</p>
<p>But since we wanted to create an algorithm that was no option. We <br />
started with a big  if / elsif / else statement. That was fine for 2 or <br />
3 tests, but then we were moving sideways. No algorithm was going to emerge.</p>
<p>That's when you need to stop and think about how to abstract a little bit further.</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify when you are moving sideways - then start abstracting</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="theend">The end</h2>
<p>No world moving lessons - but valuable non the less. Thats why I like coding dojos - <br />
they are a good place to reason about the nature of programming, without <br />
having to write production code.</p>
