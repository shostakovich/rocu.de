    of course you write some kind of proxy that filters your twitter Traffic. Unfortunately
    that task is not too simple: <a href="http://www.devthought.com/2012/01/24/filtering-tweets-for-your-favorite-client-with-node-js/"

<p>I spent far to much time on Twitter lately. Time wasted that should be <br />
used for building stuff. On the other hand I do not <br />
want to complettely abandon Twitter, because it's a great source of <br />
new links for me.</p>
<p>So I decided to filter out all Tweets without URL's.</p>
<p>I remembered that it was possible using negative lookahead - but frankly <br />
I never used it. I found the answer on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/406230/regular-expression-to-match-string-not-containing-a-word">stackoverflow</a>.</p>
<p>Just add the following filter and you are set:</p>
<pre><code>^((?!.[a-z]+/).)*$
</code></pre>
<p>Feels much better - and I can follow more great people ;)</p>
