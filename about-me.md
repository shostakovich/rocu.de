Hi. My name is Robert Curth. I am 33 years old and live in Munich (Germany).


## Programmer

I am a part-time programmer at [ARRI](http://www.arri.com) and a worker-owner at [Techgenossen](https://techgenossen.de/).
 
 I program in Ruby (on Rails) these days on [ARRI Webgate](https://arriwebgate.com/) and various Techgenossen projects.

## Traveler

I travel a lot. I visited ~45 countries during my lifetime. Most of them in the last 5 years.

## Self-improver

After work I try to invest into my skills and mind. That means: I exercise, meditate and do all other kinds of crazy stuff.
